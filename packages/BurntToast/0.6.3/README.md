PowerShell Module for displaying **Windows 10** Toast Notifications

## Install

### PowerShell Gallery Install (Requires PowerShell v5)

```powershell
    Install-Module -Name BurntToast
```

See the [PowerShell Gallery](http://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/BurntToast/) for the complete details and instructions.

### Manual Install

Download [BurntToast.zip](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.6.2/BurntToast.zip) and extract the contents into `C:\Users\[User]\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\modules\BurntToast` (you may have to create these directories if they don't exist.)

*Please remember to "**unblock**" the zip file before extracting the contents. Not doing so will result in the module not working correctly. This can be done via the file properties or with `Unblock-File`.*

## Releases

**Please note:** as of v0.5.0, BurntToast no longer works on Windows 8.

- [Bleeding Edge](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/archive/v0.7.0.zip) (Development/Raw Repo)

- [v0.6.3](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.6.3/BurntToast.zip)

  - Update Windows Community Toolkit (UWP Notifications) to 5.0.0.

    - Also switched to the UAP variant, as the .NET Standard one was causing issues for some users.

  - (BACKEND) Implemented CI pester tests on Azure DevOps Pipelines, including code coverage stats.

  - Fixed style issues flagged by Codacy, mainly Markdown headers.

  - Added WhatIf support to all functions, laying ground work for expanded (read: any) Pester tests.

  - Functions all in .psm1 now, instead of separate .ps1 files. SPEED!

- [v0.6.2](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.6.2/BurntToast.zip)

  - Updated UWP Toolkit to 2.2.0

  - Fixed an issue with sound looping

  - New-BurntToastNotification now accepts multiple ProgressBar objects

  - Fixed Issue #28, ProgressBars should now work for all locales

  - Fixed Issue #18, Images from the internet will now be downloaded locally

    - Supports regular images, hero images, and applogo

  - All functions now included in .psm1 for release (Thanks @chrislgardner)

- [v0.6.1](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.6.1/BurntToast.zip)

  - Customizable AppId removed from the New-BurntToastNotification function as a quick fix for Fall Creators Update.

    - If you''re using a customized AppId and are not upgrading to the Fall Creators Update, then stay on version 0.6.0.

  - Default AppId changed to match PowerShell.exe.

  - Registry entry for AppId is now automatically created when the module loads.

  - Included UWPCommunityToolkit library updated to v2.0.0.

- [v0.6.0](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.6.0/BurntToast.zip)

  - Updated bundled UWP Toolkit to 1.4.1

    - Note that this caused an issue where strings were being wrapped with curly braces in end results. A workaround has been implemented, but could mean that if you legitimately use some rather obscure strings, they may have the braces removed.

  - Hero Images working now (Thanks to Creators Update)

  - Headers can now be included (Creators Update feature)

  - Progress bars can now be included (Creators Update feature)

  - Specify a unique identifier in order to replace existing toasts

  - You can specify a custom sound file using the -Path parameter of the New-BTAudio function. This hasn''t been exposed through the main function... that poor thing is getting bloated.

  - There is now help for every public function, and the online version for each of them can be found on github. Specify the -Online switch when using Get-Help to be taken directly there.

- [v0.5.2](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.5.2/BurntToast.zip)

  - Exposed ability to have custom buttons via New-BurntToastNotification, passing result from New-BTButton to the -Button parameter.

    - Expect a blog post soon covering some cool ways to use these buttons. Keep an eye out on [king.geek.nz](http://king.geek.nz).

  - Fixed module commands not auto-loading by removing Basic/Advanced function designation ( :( ).

  - Help created for New-BTButton, and the function has had a pass to ensure it works as per the community toolkit.

  - Help completed for New-BurntToastNotification, and Toast alias now exporting correctly.

- [v0.5.1](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.5.1/BurntToast.zip)

  - Small bug fixes (thanks for opening issues!)
  - Confirmed: Now **ONLY** works on Windows 10
  - BurntToast now has its own, original, logo!
  - New public function to adjust function level of module: Set-BTFunctionLevel
  - Implemented checking for and registering of AppId in the registry to ensure proper Toast behaviour in the Action Center

- [v0.5.0](https://github.com/Windos/BurntToast/releases/download/v0.5.0/BurntToast.zip)

  - Converted to using the UWP Community Toolkit.
  - Snooze and Dismiss now available and working.
